-> echo hello terminal <- returns hello terminal 
	-> echo I made this boilerplate >> README.md <- to print to a file, rather than to the terminal 
		-> Text that is added to a file using this command is added to a new line 
-> pwd <- print working directory 
-> ls <- prints the names of the files in the current directory 
-> cd <- to change directory and move into a folder 
-> in this example, we have a lot of different JavaScript files in a folder 
-> cd .. <- to go back a folder level
-> more package.json <- to print the contents of a file (like head but for linux) 
-> clear <- to clear the contents of the terminal 
-> ls -l <- to print the contents of a directory in the 'long list' format 
-> cd ../.. <- to go back two folder levels 
-> mkdir website <- to make a folder (directory) called 'website' 
-> touch index.html <- to create a new file 
-> ls --help <- to show the help menu for the ls command 
-> they are making us create a `website` directory, and use the `touch` command to create an index.html, styles.css, .gitignore and index.js files
-> ls --all <- to show all of the files in the directory (including the hidden ones)
-> boilerplate code is like template code 
-> cp <file> <destination> <- to copy files into a destination directory 
-> rm <file> <- to remove (delete) a file 
	-> rm -r fonts <- to remove a folder which still has things in it (this doesn't get sent to the 'trash')
-> mv roboto.font roboto.woff <- to rename the first to the second 
	-> mv header.png ../ <- to move a file back one level in the tree 
-> find <- to view things or a file tree
	-> find directory_name <- this highlights the directory in the file tree 
	-> find -name index.html <- to print the directory of the index.html file 
-> mkdir client/src <- you're in the current directory, and there is a directory called client 
	-> This line creates another directory inside that one, called src 
	-> This is done without having to cd into the client directory 
-> rmdir images <- to remove one of the folders 
-> exit <- to exit the terminal
