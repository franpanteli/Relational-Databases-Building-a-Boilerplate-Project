These are my notes on the project task page. This project is called "Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate." The URL for the page which these notes are on is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-bash-by-building-a-boilerplate/build-a-boilerplate

- This project is all about the terminal: 
	-> Navigating the computer's file system 
	-> This can be used to run programs, automate tasks, et al 

- In this project, we are creating a website boilerplate: 
	-> We are doing this by only using the command line 
	-> The aim of this is to practice using the terminal / Bash 

- To run the project: 
	Open the Gitpod environment:
		-> We are using a virtual Linux machine 
		-> This is run with Gitpod <- like VSCode, but in the browser 
		-> On the webpage that these notes are made on, you click "start the course" 
		-> This opens a Gitpod environment 

	Then you start the CodeRoad extension: 
		-> Click the "hamburger" menu at the top LHS of the Gitpod window 
		-> Then click the "View" menu 
		-> Click on the "Command Palette" option 
		-> Then run "CodeRoad: Start"
		-> Then you follow the instructions in CodeRoad and complete the guided project 

	-> They want you to complete it in their environment, so when it is submitted integration tests can run
